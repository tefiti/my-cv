          <p>Before the summer of 2019 I had no idea what a developer does, but I gathered my courage to start  some IT courses, 
          as career tests suggested that it would be a good match for me. I used to be a pharmacist, but I didn't love it and I was 
          searching for something more meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>Now I am determined to become an excellent web developer, even though I sometimes feel overwhelmed of the distance I 
          have to cross to get there.</p>
          <p>So...why do I love programming? Because:</p>
          <p>it challenges me every day with my own limits;</p>
          <p>it allows me to be as creative as a child;</p>
          <p>I can make things that are useful to other people;</p>
          <p>after I accomplish a difficult task I feel like a superhero :) </p>
